# A simple blog app made from AWS Amplify 

This blog app is made in Amplify Sandbox. The backend is hosted in AWS using AWS AppSync and Amazon DynamoDB. I took the design from Figma and converted it into cloud connected React components in AWS Amplify.User authentication is also done using Amazon Cognito.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
